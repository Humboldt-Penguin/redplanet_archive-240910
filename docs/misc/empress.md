#  [Digital Piracy] The rise of EMPRESS - How one woman turned the pirate underworld on its head, waged a solo war against the entire game industry (and won), went mad with power, started a messianic cult based on high school-level philosophy, and faked her own arrest to spite her rivals and haters

# An Introduction to Piracy

Most of us have torrented something at some point, whether it’s a game, movie, book, song or TV show, but just for those who haven’t, I’ll explain the basics.

When you go to a site like The Pirate Bay or Kick Ass Torrents, and click ‘Download Torrent’, all you’re really getting is a link. Programmes like Bittorrent or Vuze are able to open those links, and will let you download almost any file, legal or not. But you’re not downloading it from a server somewhere, a website, or a single person, you’re downloading it from dozens, sometimes thousands of people at the same time, all around the world. Those are known as ‘seeders’. And while you do that, other people are downloading the file from you. They’re ‘leechers’. The original distributor of the file created that torrent, and submitted it to torrenting websites so that other people could find it, but once they’ve shared the full file once, they can break off their connection to the torrent. 

This is known as [‘Peer to Peer’ file sharing]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFswNCU5CKA), and it’s the primary means of distributing media illegally, because it’s basically impossible to stop. If a website is hosting episodes of Game of Thrones, you can shut the website down. If a person is sending out files, you can sue them. But no company or corporation, however powerful, can stop a torrent (though many have tried). 

Sharing a movie or a song is easy – you just distribute the file. It will work no matter who downloads it. But games are different. Since a game is made up of loads of files working in tandem and tangled up in a confusing spider-web of code, the developer is able to ‘booby trap’ the game so that it doesn’t work when it’s copied.

For as long as developers have been doing this, savvy hackers and programmers have been working to undo it. When they do, the developers go back to the drawing board and come up with something smarter. 

[Cassettes were easily duplicated]( https://medium.com/@gaoquan196/the-decline-of-action-games-74bc6abb678), so the industry invented consoles with more secure cartridges and built-in ROMs that could detect fakes. Pirates reverse-engineered the consoles to make their own duplicate consoles which could run both legitimate and fake copies. So the industry moved to CDs, because they had more storage space and could be fitted with new security features. Pirates cracked the CDs. Developers started requiring a game key, so pirates created key-generators to fool them. The developers came back with copy-detection software, so the pirates cracked the software. The companies started using DRM that forced players to remain connected and logged into the company’s servers at all times. Pirates cracked that too.  

This game of cat-and-mouse has been going on for decades, steadily growing more complex and inscrutable. The stakes are high. By some estimates, [piracy costs tens of billions a year]( https://atelier.net/insights/the-sharks-versus-the-pirates-grey-markets-in-gaming). By other estimates, [it costs almost nothing]( https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-09-25-eu-commission-no-evidence-that-piracy-affects-video-games-sales). To the game industry, every pirated game is a lost sale. 

But who are these pirates, anyway?

# The Warez Scene 

Pirates tend to work in tightly-knit ‘Warez’ groups, and these groups are bound together in a secretive, world-wide, decentralised network called ‘[The Scene]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warez_scene)’. While the Scene has no leader, it has come to adhere to strict rules and regulations. If a release breaks these rules, other groups will ‘nuke’ it – flagging it as bad content. From the outside, they may seem like the Robin Hoods of the industry, stealing video games from the rich and distributing them to the poor, but don’t let that fool you. Warez groups are motivated by competition, not generosity. They all want to be the best. The first group to release a cracked game wins – any cracks to release after that are considered worthless (and are subsequently nuked). There’s no prize, of course. But in the Scene, prestige is its own reward. 

In one of their info files (often the only way a group communicates with pirates), the group SKIDROW said the following:

> Keep in mind we do all this, because we can and because we like the thrilling excitement of winning over the other competing groups. We absolutely don't do all these releases, to please the general user that rather want to spend their cash on updating to the latest hardware, and sees the scene releases as a source to play all these games for free. Enjoy playing and remember if you like it, support the developer! 

The group MYTH said the same thing:

> We do this just for FUN. We are against any profit or commercialisation of piracy. We do not spread any release, others do that. In fact, we BUY all our own games with our own hard earned and worked for efforts. Which is from our own real life non-scene jobs. As we love game originals. Nothing beats a quality original. "If you like this game, BUY it. We did!"

The Scene comprises thousands of active groups, most flickering in and out of existence within the space of a few months. Some came and dominated for a while, but couldn’t adapt to the challenges companies placed before them, and inevitably faded into obscurity. Every era of piracy had its big names. PARADOX, RELOADED, SKIRDOW and RAZOR1911 are all good examples. The competition was fierce, so no single group held on to the spotlight for long. 
 
But everything changed when the industry pulled out its trump card.

# Denuvo Anti-Tamper

[Denuvo]( https://irdeto.com/denuvo/) is a piece of anti-tamper software, developed in Austria and first released in September 2014. At first, pirates saw it as yet another obstacle which would be overcome and set aside. But it gradually became clear that Denuvo was going to be more of a challenge. 

I’m not remotely intelligent enough to go into exactly what Denuvo does in detail, [though these people are.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/3ayhcj/denuvo_how_does_it_work/)  It’s difficult to understand because it was *designed to be*. But the simple version is that it scrambles the code inside the .exe (the file that boots the game) and decrypts it on the fly, using information from Denuvo’s servers, and from your computer. The first time you run the game, it will tailor itself to the nooks and crannies of hardware, which acts kind of like a fingerprint. This way, it can detect if it’s been copied to a different device, or if the .exe has been tampered with.

It’s hard to overstate how big a difference Denuvo made. At a time when games were being cracked less than a day after hitting shelves, this software could keep them out of pirates’ hands for literally years. Many people on the Scene thought Denuvo was truly impenetrable. That reputation got around, and soon almost every game came with it baked in. 

There are claims that Denuvo has [all sorts of negative effects]( https://www.howtogeek.com/400126/what-is-denuvo-and-why-do-gamers-hate-it/) on games, from [slowing load times]( https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/evidence-continues-to-mount-about-how-bad-denuvo-is-for-pc-gaming-performance/) to taking a toll on hardware. It’s also possible that due to the way Denuvo works, once the company stops supporting older games, or new hardware becomes too different to old hardware, gamers may be totally unable to play. There’s a lot of debate about [whether these effects are real]( https://crappygames.miraheze.org/wiki/Denuvo_Anti-Tamper) but it's hard to know who to trust, because everyone has a narrative to push. Pirates go to great lengths to discredit Denuvo, and corporations work hard to defend it. 

> “The Denuvo anti-tamper technology is ultimately to protect the gaming industry and ensure game studios have an ability to continue to invest and build new games,” said a representative in a statement. “On PC, a large proportion of games (especially the AAA games) tend to be protected for a period of time to protect the monetization of the games being launched—say six months or 12 months for example.”

It took three months for the first breakthrough. 3DM, a warez group from China, successfully breached Denuvo on 1st December 2014. Thirty days after it came out, 3DM released Dragon Age Inquisition onto the Scene. But major video games made most of their sales within the first month, [so that was still a victory for the developers]( https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-08-29-denuvo-and-irdeto-on-protecting-early-sales-from-piracy).

Games came out in drips and drabs for a while. In all of 2015, only six games were cracked. 3DM gradually fell behind their biggest competitor, CPY. When CPY cracked Metal Gear Solid V only nine days after it hit shelves, there were optimistic whispers that perhaps Denuvo could be defeated after all. But that was a folly.  

In January 2016, Rise of the Tomb Raider came out, and with it was a new and improved version of Denuvo. Whatever had changed, it was enough to terrify 3DM. Within days of its release, they admitted defeat.

> “The last stage is too difficult and Jun nearly gave up, but last Wednesday I encouraged him to continue,” the founder, known by her internet handle “Phoenix”, said.

>“I still believe that this game can be compromised. But according to current trends in the development of encryption technology, in two years’ time I’m afraid there will be no free games to play in the world,”

3DM all but disappeared from the Scene after that. CPY was the only group left with any prospects of taking down Denuvo. They toiled quietly in the background for days. The days became weeks. Weeks became months. And the video game piracy community fell into a long, deep hibernation, fuelled only by memes and indie games. 

And then one morning, it awoke. Tomb Raider had been cracked. It had taken 193 days, but CPY had done it.

>The day CPY gave us Hope again ...

After that, the games began to release more regularly – around a week or two apart. Since CPY was the only group capable of breaking Denuvo, they owned the Scene in a way no other group ever really had. From August 2016 through to May the next year, almost nothing got cracked without their input. It still took at least a month to crack a single game, but the number of days gradually got smaller and smaller. When Resident Evil Biohazard got cracked within five days, [the call once again went out that Denuvo had truly been defeated, for sure this time.]( https://www.techspot.com/news/80084-denuvo-protected-games-cracked-faster-than-ever.html)

>And the scene and outsiders of the scene have completely dismantled and destroyed them. Far cry from the fear everyone originally had. Every new protection is scary at first but when it comes down to it...if there are people smart enough to create it...there are people smart enough to reverse engineer it! Cheers to all the groups and individuals who crushed them and will continue to do so as it evolves.

Over time, CPY started collaborating more with other groups, who themselves picked up the tricks for circumventing Denuvo. BALDMAN and STEAMPUNKS began to dominate between June and October 17. Between them, there were pirated games coming out almost every day.  CODEX was there too, first working on collabs, and then on their own. From 2018 to 2020, they made up most of the releases, and CPY made up the rest.

And there was also a woman called EMPRESS. 

# Long Live the Queen

The rise of EMPRESS didn’t come as a shock; it was a gradual takeover. She first appeared under the name C000005, and had a history working with the popular cracker CODEX. Her first Denuvo cracks under the name EMPRESS came in mid-2017 as part of larger collaborations. One of these, ‘Total War Warhammer 2’, involved no less than six scene groups, plus EMPRESS on top.

She worked her way up from three collabs in 2017, to five in 2018, and a few the next year too, and it wasn’t until her solo debut with the cracked version of ‘Planet Zoo’ that she really made waves.

Between October 2020 and July 2021, EMPRESS would reign supreme. Of the fifteen major cracks during that period, she was behind eight.

But it wasn’t just her skill that drew attention. It was the fact that she bucked every trend in the Scene. She wasn’t part of some secretive group, she was one woman out to declare war against an industry worth tens of billions, and she won, with nothing more than her own intelligence. The normal Scene motivations of glory and prestige meant nothing to her (so she claimed), it was all about saving games. She made the cardinal sin of commenting on the CrackWatch subreddit, and did it freely. She posted [polls]( https://www.reddit.com/r/EmpressEvolution/comments/ltw7nl/new_poll_vote_for_the_next_game_release/) asking what games the community wanted next, called out her competitors, interacted with fans, and shared her (often enigmatic) [philosophical views]( https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/comments/meirzz/crashbandicoot4empress/gshheef/). And unlike the other groups, she accepted donations.

In short, she was everything the Scene hated. But they couldn’t touch her – none of them could. She was one of the only people in the world capable of breaching Denuvo, so no-one could justify any measures against her. And even if the Scene tried to ‘nuke’ her releases, people would download them anyway – such was her fan following. 

>Groups targeted whichever games they pleased, insulating themselves from outside input, to say nothing of requests. And a lot of the time, they didn’t update their releases to account for bug fixes or software changes, fating their achievements to obsolescence. Empress doesn’t think they loved video games. They loved themselves, and winning. “Everything they did was just a way to ‘prove’ themselves and boost their fake meaningless Egos,’” says Empress.

EMPRESS became the closest thing the piracy community had to a celebrity. People loved her. 

 [In a February interview with Wired]( https://www.wired.com/story/empress-drm-cracking-denuvo-video-game-piracy/), EMPRESS said she had been called to the purpose through dreams. A copy of Dark Souls 2 floated before her, wrapped up in chains made of numbers, and as she focused, she began to see what every number meant ‘universally’. Looking deeper still, she entered ‘The Zone’, which allowed her to ‘SEE MORE into everything’, and shatter the chains. When asked about her process, EMPRESS said, “By mixing philosophy with coding. It’s very complicated. I have a ‘Goal’ that no one else has. I have no need for Ego.” This is the kind of larger-than-life persona she adopted. 

Of course, there were those who simply couldn’t believe Empress was a woman. She had to be a man – or even a group of men. To this, she said: 

>”[to all the GENDER FREAKS out there]( https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/comments/jfxsv3/reddeadredemption2empressmr_goldberg/g9myn9e/?context=3) who keep claiming out of their own ass that I am a male, I am so sorry to ruin your fantasy dreams of a trans cracker is false and yes I am actually a woman.
Next time if you want to speak about your pathetic fetishes, you better look at yourself in the mirror.” She would later say, “i am 23 years old, and i am beautiful AS HELL. but i don't care 1 bit how i ‘look.’ i care of what i ‘Do.’”

The Wired interview is revealing and bizarre in equal measure.

> “i think the main problem is that people ‘fail’ to see Video Games as the pinnacle and max potential of ‘art,’” Empress says that as a child she was a “very strange girl who did not like the ‘Real World’ as much as other people seem to.” More than the average gamer, she says, she has always taken games seriously not just as a way to pass the time, but as places to go and be. She loved Tetris on the NES, for when she wanted to “go ‘beyond’ the human limits in terms of ‘Response’ and ‘creativity.’” She loved Megaman 1, “for philosophical reasons that people do not understand.”

> “i always keep in the ZONE till i crush their pathetic puzzle prisons,” she says. Cracking DRM has taught her that the only real way to view the games industry right now is through the lens of philosophy. Philosophy helps people discern what is valuable, she says. And to discern what is valuable, you must look for higher truths. The higher truth in gaming, she says, is that “wanting to preserve something you ‘Buy’ should NEVER be a ‘Crime.’”

> Recently, she cracked Anno 1800, which layered three types of protection, Denuvo on top. “No one else does this because it requires insane amount of focus, dedication and endless passion. I was able to achieve this only in several months of research. it was HELL to say the least.”

The video game piracy community had long been a separate world to the Scene. Each understood the existence of the other, but didn’t care about their motivations, only their results. Gamers didn’t give a shit about the bizarre Warez industry or its search for clout; as long as cracks came out, that was all that mattered. And vice versa, as far as the Scene was concerned, gamers existed only to reinforce that clout. It was a confused but mutually beneficial relationship. 

So when EMPRESS came along, espousing virtuous anti-corporate goals and beating the big publishers at their own game, the piracy community fell in love. In fact, her releases were sometimes [even better than the official versions]( https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/ohgjmr/resident_evil_village_crack_completely_fixes_its/h4ozkrb/). Her fan-following rapidly grew into an almost cult-like [obsession]( https://www.reddit.com/r/EmpressEvolution/comments/lv3gqw/thank_you_empress/gpb1mru/?context=3). She was half-jokingly called the messiah of video games. [The community]( https://www.reddit.com/r/EmpressEvolution/comments/nhy2aw/philosophy_post_005_happiness/) became full of her [bizarre philosophical exercises]( https://www.reddit.com/r/EmpressEvolution/comments/lxvtgq/mini_game_000_what_do_you_think_the_most/), [reviews]( https://www.reddit.com/r/EmpressEvolution/comments/lw8zda/empress_game_review_000_test_drive_unlimited_2/), and even a few diss tracks. 

>“The reason why Ubisoft, EA and such companies never remove denuvo from their games is only because they LOVE feeling *superior* and ENJOY seeing you the customer as PIG under their control or worse.” 

The corporations tried to use her fame against her. She announced her releases ahead of time with a lot of fanfare, and gave regular updates on her progress. So when news got out that EMPRESS was about to crack Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, Ubisoft sabotaged the game so that players couldn’t fight two of the bosses. Then when the crack released, they removed the bug. EMPRESS’s version had to be fixed by other crackers. 

But they couldn’t hold her off forever. The revolution had arrived, and it had found its Robbespierre. When the coveted Red Dead Redemption 2 release came out, she was on top of the world.  

But we all know what happened to Robbespierre.

# Are we Pirates or are we Dancer?

EMPRESS first began to lose followers through her ‘philosophy’.  She had come to believe she had a totally unique view on the world that no one could even begin to understand. As far as Empress was concerned, she had the ‘perfect and totally correct’ answer to all philosophical questions. Whether this sense of grandeur had its origin in drugs, or the praise she was getting, or something else, it’s hard to say. In her first major philosophy post, she said, “I have always had lots of universal philosophy knowledge inside my soul and it always opposes the famous philosophers and thinkers' theories, and pretty much "Everyone else" on this planet.” 

[Aside from balking at the audacity of using a platform for piracy as her own personal blog, the community was quick to knock her down a peg.]( https://www.reveddit.com/v/CrackWatch/comments/ksnx3u/a_philosophical_approach_toward_the_people_and/?context=3&ps_after=1610075803%2C1610107318%2C1610141831%2C1610291679%2C1614286019)

>So I guess you read them all? The great thinkers? To verify how you are above and beyond their thinking?

>Do you understand how utterly arrogant this post makes you? I will tell you why.
To put yourself above thinkers like Arthur Schopenhauer, Adam Smith, John Locke, Charles-Louis de Secondat, Immanuel Kant, Thomas Hobbes, Baruch Spinoza, Francisco de Vitoria, Friedrich Nietzsche and so many others. Human beings who have helped shape the foundation of the world we live in today. I am talking about the most basic of basic stuff we now take for granted like property, human rights, democratic governance and rule of law. Without these ideas and those who dedicated their lives to refine them, our world could not be like it is today.

This was a strong argument, but as someone else jokingly pointed out:

>bitch shut up, they pirated rdr2

Which, to be fair, Hobbes and Kant never did.

The next philosophy post came with a ‘shitlist’ of all the people who had opposed her.

> many people has put their heart and soul in their replies, and some of them were "very close" to the truth , while others tried their best to be DICKHEADS and speak with a brain of a cockroach. i list them below.

This didn’t earn her any friends. There were discussions of banning her completely. In order to find a compromise, EMPRESS went and created her own platform, with blackjack and hookers. It wasn’t too successful, but her most ardent disciples happily made the jump, and most of the piracy community was happy to see the end of her bizarre posts. 

But the bliss wouldn’t last. Empress was shortly suspended, her followers scattered. No one seemed to care much about that.

# Fuck You, Pay Me

You might remember the part when I said EMPRESS accepted [donations]( https://www.reddit.com/r/EmpressEvolution/comments/loe53n/empress_donation_addresses/). That would become a pretty big part of this. The most important thing to EMPRESS was cracking games, but a girl gotta eat. She had a real job. When fans donated money, she was able to take time away from that job to spend on cracking. “How much time I spend in it depends on the amount of donations I receive.” In other words, fans could pay her to get pirated games faster. Empress knew the value of her work, and expected to be compensated for it. 

> [requiring money to keep working on this cancer is something that is a "must", and its not my choice or anyone else's.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/EmpressEvolution/comments/ou0ks7/vote_for_the_next_game_crack/)

>The undeniable truth is-- this life requires this whether we like it or not... because otherwise there is no human capable of just magically producing cracks for the most annoying cancer drm in this world.

>the most talented crackers in the SCENE left and worked for DENUVO for this same reason ... and to avoid my fate ending up in any negative way too, i am requesting all of your help to keep struggling and crushing this drm with every new version they make.

In September 2020, [she approached the piracy community]( https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/comments/iyj73x/i_will_need_your_help_moving_forward/) with a confession. After ending her solo career and joining a more traditional Scene group, she was back. The Scene was dead, she proclaimed, and [they wouldn’t be coming to help.]( https://64.media.tumblr.com/3a5284b1a10e6e888de8e643ecdda8d7/tumblr_p2j2s2SCsA1qzcmp3o3_540.gif) In fact, many of the recent Denuvo releases by other groups had been mainly done by EMPRESS. There were even questions of whether the Scene was deliberately delaying crack releases because they were being paid off by the industry. [Conspiracies ran wild.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/comments/iyj73x/i_will_need_your_help_moving_forward/g6d0nyc/) 

> If you had high hopes for the scene to make some miracle comeback, I have bad news for you. Even before the busts, the scene's state was already very rotten and most of the people inside are nothing but leechers of fake fame based on on some old ass "glory". I made the Planet Zoo crack in 1 week, I made crack for Total War Three Kingdoms in 4 days and they were both ready to go in early August. But the lack of even tiny bit action from the people who should have moved things forward, made me completely blocked in what it seem to be infinite stagnation. Because I had to wait them, almost 2 months... I couldn't do any progress on Denuvo AT ALL. And as a result I became very tired. And you wait those people to save you? Especially after the busts, 95% of the scene is in dead silence. My mistake was leaving you and going with them in promises of fake support , so I am sorry for that. 

This all lead up to the pitch: there was a new Denuvo variant out there, and if it could be broken, pirates could get their hands on games like Death Stranding and Resident Evil 3. But she would need to dedicate herself wholly to it, and that meant relying fully on donations. 

The Scene didn’t take this lying down. In the info files of their own releases, they slated EMPRESS’s greed and unsavoury motivations. In their crack for ‘Iron Harvest’, the group DARKSiDERS had this to say:

> As we do this without profit from own pockets, we supply them games, buy em... EMPRESS you are asking money for piracy!!

>We think thats more rotten then CODEX themselfs!!

>We also have our real-life jobs todo and we would not ever ask money!

>SHAME ON YOU! For starters piracys basic princible is...: FREE!"

>*ALSO THiNG iS

>You are calling scene toxic just cuz were on one

>biggest groups. We re really chilled and let ppl

>do things on their own pace. Most of sceners are

>Ä bit angry at the fact that codex used/uses

>MONEY for crackers, scene dont do that usually.

But EMPRESS was always ready with a response.

> They must understand I do not care about their shitty competition. We are not talking here about making profit from cracking itself, we are talking about saving the right to preserve your games and own them, because in current days no matter how much money you have, you simply cannot buy true ownership anymore. Instead you have to install 3 launchers and go through several sever authorizations in order to play your games. This missions requires extreme dedication and time put into it. So, yes, naturally requires financing as well, one way or another. Don't you think I don't hate asking for money, but it's how the things are.

>They said it themselves, they chill and do nothing, because are lazy old bastards, who only speak but never do anything. Also I know about several german groups making money through giving early pre information to p2p sites, so don't give me that scene morality again.

>DARKSiDERS, you are bottom of the scene with SKIDROW and you know exactly what I am talking about.

No one had ever seen anything like it on the Scene before. Empress thought she was better than everyone else, and she kind of was (at least, as far as cracking was concerned).  However the piracy community started to sour on her over time, partly because of her requests for money, and partly because of her weirdly preachy and arrogant philosophical ramblings, which people often felt forced to slog through because they sometimes held hints about future cracks. Plus [some of these philosophical opinions]( https://camas.github.io/reddit-search/# {%22author%22:%22-InfinityQueen-%22,%22searchFor%22:1,%22resultSize%22:100}) came across as a little transphobic.  She was starting to get a reputation as a bit of a nut job who had let the whole thing go to her head. 

This wasn’t helped when when EMPRESS released the crack for ‘Immortals: Fenyx Rising’. Pirates noticed that they had extremely low download speeds, and figured out that she was deliberately throttling her own torrent. Why? [Because she didn’t want any other pirates repacking and re-uploading her cracks]( https://fitgirl-repacks.site/my-statement-about-empress/). To clarify, a repacker takes a torrent, strips away the fluff, compresses it down to a tiny size, and releases it again. Repacks are made for people who struggle downloading large files. EMPRESS wanted a monopoly over the spotlight, and tried to prevent repackers getting hold of the game. This led to new beef with the person re-packing most of her releases, [‘FitGirl’]( https://fitgirl-repacks.site/my-statement-about-empress/), promising never to work with EMPRESS’s cracks again. 

In July, she went as far as to hold cracks hostage. Following one of her regular polls, she said “the highest vote choice will not win if i don't receive 500$ for it. the people who will vote for the highest demanded game need to cooperate and collect 500$ for me to crack the game. this way it doesn't have to just be "1" single indvidual suffering for the entire thing when everyone else gets the game for free later.”

No money, no crack. Those were the terms. 

Pirates were stingy at the best of times – that’s why they were pirates. But there were no alternatives. It was EMPRESS or nothing. It was a lot cheaper to throw a dollar or two her way than to buy a game at full price. All that talk of ‘saving video games’ was starting to ring hollow. The push-back against her was enormous.

> if id wanted to pay money id just buy the game, this is retarded and you should be ashamed of this. you shouldnt crack games for the money you should do it for the ideology or for the competition. this is a disgrace. shame on you

There was also the problem of preference – people wouldn’t donate towards cracking games they didn’t even like. One fan pointed out: “people might still support you so you don't starve to death but you are probably gonna lose respect if your choice of games don't align with that of most people who follow you.”

> “Every fu*cking time these kids vote for a childish anime game instead of an open world game.”

But EMPRESS wouldn’t be cowed by abuse. Far from backing down, she continued calling out to potential contributors and sponsors, and promised that if anyone had a specific game they were desperate to get cracked, a simple payment of $500 dollars would make it happen. 

This was open to a lot of manipulation – all a company had to do to protect their newest release was pay EMPRESS to focus on something else instead. 

> “the entire ‘Scene’ rules that accept ‘no money/donations’ is 1 of the biggest problems which always push the crackers back, instead of forward,” says Empress. “if you’re going to do such INSANE EFFORT, you wouldn't just do it for and from ‘nothing’

EMPRESS would try to let her fans decide how they wanted the process of donating to go, but that quickly devolved into chaos, fuelled by her detractors. But her supporters gave as good as they got, and the resulting firestorm grew steadily more toxic until it overflowed into every piracy-related space. All the while, she continued preaching her philosophy and attacking anyone who opposed it.

>i suggest you all go for a self re-check, you people have stinking shallow mind and souls... my philosophy is the "UNIVERSAL" type, and the term "Subjective" means NOTHING in my world. [if you STILL not convinced and disagree of anything i said in this post, i congratulate you because it means you didn't understand a SINGLE WORD from what i said. please enjoy an empty pathetic life].

# Wanted Woman

The was a great danger looming over EMPRESS’s rise to stardom. The law. After all, there was a reason why members of the Scene kept a low profile. Companies couldn’t touch the torrents, but with just enough information, they could take down the people making them. Other pirates (such as one named Voksi) had been apprehended before, and sometimes the plea deal even involved working for Denuvo. It could happen again. Fans urged EMPRESS to be careful. They thought she was sticking her neck out far too much. 

>I hope you get all the support you want but keep safe.

EMPRESS promised she would, but it wasn’t enough. Or so it seemed. 

[In February 2021, she announced that thanks to her haters and rivals]( https://torrentfreak.com/denuvo-cracker-empress-arrested-blames-repacker-fitgirl-reddit-for-witch-hunt-210224/), who had leaked her address to the authorities, she had been well and truly nicked. 

>some serious people ON REDDIT managed to report me to authority with my real address, i am not quiet sure how it happened, but even with putting my philosophical side aside, i think i pissed off the entire internet just by trying to control "MY" own crack for 24 hour is actually something i am still not able to believe. in less than an hour, i will be dragged out of my home here with my lawyer, but considering i was caught red handed while preparing version 2 fix for my immortals crack, i don't think there will be much of hope against it at all.

Her message to those who had insulted her was totally not at all bitter – she thought they were ‘all beautiful people’ who she definitely didn’t hate, because they had just made a mistake. This was all somewhat rich for a woman who was rapidly developing hints of megalomania and power-madness. 

And then she made an Obi-wan-esque speech about ‘remembering me’ and ‘contuing on my path’. 

Everyone was quick to point out the flaws here. The police generally don’t bust down your door, catching you ‘red-handed’ cracking Denuvo, then call you to tell you they’re going to arrest you in an hour, so you have time to write out a long and dramatic letter blaming others for your woes. 

>”I will be there in less than an hour to take you in. please don't delete any incriminating data. thanks." 

Other crackers weighed in on the hilarity of the whole thing, especially Fitgirl, whom EMPRESS mentioned by name. Some users went straight to mockery.

>This infinity crackhead has really gone of the deep end.

But to much of the community, it was just kind of sad.

>EMPRESS, if what you want is just ask us to forget all about the last few days/weeks and move on, just say so. It's fine, we will. You don't need to make up stories.

I think the funniest response to the whole letter is “Ma'am, this is a Wendy's.”

>I really admired her... before she went batshit, like, she was the only one cracking denuvo, asking us what we wanted cracked next, for a time, she was the real queen of the pirates...then she went full fascist, started rambling about gender supremacy, seeing enemies everywhere, shit just went down hill, shit

But worry not! Despite being caught in the act of piracy, EMPRESS would proclaim on her website that the investigation had ended and her lawyer had gotten her off the hook. She was back to cracking. It was a long and gruelling prison sentence that went on for over three months, but she had survived.

Jokes. This announcement came two days after the alleged arrest. Apparently the ‘police raid’ was nothing more than a lenient, routine police check. 

But nonetheless, the harrowing experience had reformed Empress into a new woman. She apologised to the people she had offended, and promised to start again without hate or conflict. 

>i am very emotional soul, and i burst with emotions quiet easily. so i want to give an official apology to ALL repackers, and ALL people who ever got offended from me due to that. i messed up before, but i will not mess up again. i put hope in your kindness, and your ability to forgive.

For once, her fans and haters were united. They were all happy to see her back. Whether she had really been arrested, or had simply invented the whole thing as an excuse to reinvent herself, they hoped it would be a positive change. 

> I am happy with it. Everyone makes mistakes in their lives. I hope you are doing well after this and everything will be back to normal.

[…]

>Mistakes happen but it is brave of u that u accepted those mistakes and want to start afresh! You will always have the chance to start afresh and nobody can take that from you! Now prove that you are the best and have a peaceful relationship with everyone!

>Thank you for your efforts

Of course, [there were those who thought this was yet another stunt]( https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/comments/ls6njg/empress_announces_her_return_and_says_shes_saved/). People were starting to question her claims about the Scene being dead. Perhaps, they said, EMPRESS had become a lone wolf because she was kind of antisocial. 

>if they wanna start fresh why not come clean about the police lie? it was so obvious.

There were pundits asking when the Netflix adaptation would come out, and others congratulating her on the world’s shortest police investigation. 

>this is like a soup opera i fucking love it

So where are we now? Well the philosophy came back with a vengeance, but it was largely contained to EMPRESS’s own subreddit and her website. Her releases, such as Resident Evil Village and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, have helped earn back some goodwill. 

Speaking for the whole community, one man said:

> I just wanna play games man jeez...

# ”I don’t wanna get black fungus, thank you”

Unfortunately, this redemption arc would not come to pass.

EMPRESS just couldn’t keep from stirring shit. Not long after her dramatic return, she went on an odd [rant against Indians]( https://i.imgur.com/V7hwbcp.jpeg), and announced that she was done being Pirate Jesus, she wanted to be Pirate Pinochet now. 

>the days of “the kind empress” is LONG GONe and FINISHED.

>MALES has “proved” they are TRASH. And I only need the “good” ones, those who actually have a brain in their skull.

>and to anyone wondering, YES I hate 99% of india’s retards.

>I know who here is indian, and I haven’t spoken against them cause of their “country”. but I will NEVER stop expressing how I hate that country as a “Whole”. 

When someone asked if she had ever visited India, she confirmed that she had not. 

This caused a lot of drama. As it turns out, there are quite a few Indians out there. And since a lot of games don’t sell in India, they make up a LOT of the piracy community. One of my favourite responses (from user /u/Don11390) was this:

> Wow. As an Indian guy, I went from "Oh, she's basically a chuuni character that escaped into our world from some shitty manga" to "I really hope she gets hit by a truck" after seeing that screenshot.

Of course, most people already hated her, and the rest weren’t going to change their minds. [The only reason she gained any attention was because people wanted games.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/PiratedGames/comments/np3uc3/empress_true_colors/)

> Yeah the amount of fuck I give about this is so small that it doesn't even register on a scale. All I care about is free games. I would suck Satan's dick if he was the one cracking denuvo js..

I wish there was some happy ending to this. But there isn't, really. EMPRESS is still doing her thing, and everyone's happy to hand-wave it away as long as she delivers the good shit. 

And if that doesn’t just burst with Christmas Spirit, what does?
