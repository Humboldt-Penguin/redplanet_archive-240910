I hate to sound elitist, but the reality is an undergraduate degree gets you nowhere near the standard required for academic level publishing. Your reasoning skills will most likely be insufficiently refined. Most undergraduates tend to over generalise,,try to tackle to broad a subject and frequently fail to adequately demonstrate the conclusions in their arguments. Even a Masters degree is unlikely to give you sufficient training to achieve academic standard work, there are exceptions, I got my first paper published after finishing my bachelors, but it was extremely tightly focused and took me six months to run it. Whereas now with a PhD I could probably have churned out something better in 4 to 5 weeks. In my view, the most important differentiator between somebody who has a PhD and somebody who does not is that PhD holders are much more willing to acknowledge when they simply do not know.

Ok ok ok.

So.

First off how you feel is EXACTLY NORMAL. Nobody walks into grad school and just knows what’s going on and hits the ground running with no conversation. Nobody. And anyone who tells you otherwise is lying to you to make themselves look smarter.

Second, the best advice I was ever given about grad school is this: Don’t try to reinvent the field on your own. You don’t have to figure everything out yourself from scratch. You don’t have to understand all the papers. Read them. Take notes, particularly on the bits that you don’t understand or are confusing, and then go talk to your assigned mentor. Ask questions. Ask questions like it’s going out of style. Ask so many questions they think you’re possessed by the ghost of a particularly enthusiastic toddler.

And get in the lab! Ask your mentor where to start! What needs to be done! What can you do for the project! This is a lab rotation so you aren’t there to be doing your own brand new secret project, you’re there to get a feel for what kind of work the group does, the group culture, and whether or not any or all of that is a good fit for you. Nothing you do during this rotation scientifically matters. No one in your cohort is getting a publication out of this. There is ZERO PRESSURE at this point, so relax. You’ll have plenty of time to beat yourself up later. Trust me.

Finally, get either a carabiner or a lanyard for your keys. I keep mine hooked in a belt loop and shoved in my pocket. A lot of people keep them on a lanyard. If you don’t regularly use all your keys, then leave all but the one to get into the building and the one for your office in your desk and just carry those two on the lanyard.

If you aren’t in the habit of keeping a phone on you, I’d consider investing in a smart watch. Especially if you’re in a wet lab there may be situations where you need to call for help or other people urgently need you (ie something is on fire and they need to know what it is to put it out). They’re also handy for calendar reminders and alarms, which is a plus.

It’s gonna be ok though. I promise. I’m almost done and I can’t tell you how many dumb things I’ve done or days I’ve felt how you’re feeling now (like everyone is ahead of me or doing better than me or is somehow smarter). It took a long time but I’ve discovered that pretty much everyone is doing a “fake it til you make it” and the only difference between them and me is that they’ve been at this longer.

So TLDR; Take a deep breath, this is normal. Ask for help. Ask all the questions. Don’t try to reinvent the wheel. Get a lanyard and wear your keys all the time and consider a smart watch so you don’t have to worry about setting down your phone.
