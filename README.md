I completely rewrote this project, see the main repo at: https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/redplanet

This repo serves as a temporary archive in case I need it.

I moved this to a separate repo to clean up the commit history, especially since my `.git` got inflated from misc large files I pushed for no reason. This repo will be deleted from GitHub at some point.
