[1] `rclone link <file>`

    - but this defaults to "people in your company": https://files.catbox.moe/4iy8mr.png
        - i can't change the default permissions in my settings for some reason bleh

[3] first share entire folder w proper perms, then `rclone link <file>`

trying json logs:

[1] --use-json-log

    $ rclone link rubox:_test/linksharing/24-05-05__goose_reply.txt --use-json-log -vv --log-file temp.txt
    >> logfile doesn't have the link spat out to stdout
    

[2] powershell piping
    
    $ rclone link rubox:_test/linksharing/24-05-05__goose_reply.txt > temp.txt
    
    - this actually works! *HOWEVER i need to find a way to spit out filename as well!
