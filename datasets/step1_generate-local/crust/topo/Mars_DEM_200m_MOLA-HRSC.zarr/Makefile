# TODO: just abandon the dumbass `docker compose` thing, it requires users to install something else, and it's introducing more dependencies/processes that are ultimately unnecessary/overcomplicated since i'm only ever building/running a single container (not to mention i don't even fully understand what docker compose up is doing in large part and what features it has)
dataset:
	mkdir -p data
	docker compose -f build/compose.yaml up --build 

clean:
	rm -rf data/
